# Machine_learning_algorithms

This folder contains implementation of various machine learning algorithms. Implementation contained are prompts of both regression and classification problems. This repository contains some initial folders
1. Ensemble technique

Ensemble technique generally means ensemble of varius base models which are further divided into Bagging and Boosting techniques. Bagging represents parallel implementation of base models whereas Boosting represents sequential representation of base models. Ensemble folder is subdivided into :

1. Random Forest
2. Random Forest vs Bagging technique
3. Adaboost
4. Gradient Boosting
5. Xgboost

We tried to use similar dataset for classification and also regression across all the algorithms.
